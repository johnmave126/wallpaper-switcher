# Wallpaper Switcher
Wallpaper management for multi-monitor setup on Windows, built on [Electron](https://github.com/atom/electron).

## Installing
Clone the repository and perform:

```bash
$ npm install
```

### Prerequisites
- `git`
- `python` (`v2.7` recommended for `node-gyp`)
- VC++ Build Environment

Delivering a pre-built out-of-box version is on the roadmap.

## Usage

To enable the backend service run on startup:
```bash
$ npm run addautorun
```

To remove the backend service run on startup:
```bash
$ npm run removeautorun
```

To bring up config program and change wallpaper settings:
```bash
$ npm start
```
The config program recreates the native Windows 10 settings app experience. Zero learning curve for windows users.

Delivering a installer that handles autorun automatically is on the roadmap.
